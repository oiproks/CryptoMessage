# CryptoMessage
Windows Form App to encrypt and decrypt messages

This small app provides an easy cypher/decypher tool for messages.
The key used to encode messages is saved locally, and can be regenerated, exported and imported as a keyfile

The keyfile itself is encoded.

The entire project was just an excuse to approach AES encryption algorithm.
